A list with three objects encompassing three batches, 48 QC samples,
42 long-term reference samples and 5000 features

\description{
The untargeted LC-MS metabolomics data was collected as per the associated 
publication. In brief, the data was preprocessed using the \pkg{xcms}
package and biological samples were removed.
