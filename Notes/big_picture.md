# Big picture 4.6

Forked and prepared folder structure for developing batchCorr for Bioconductor. Made a tentative vignette which illustrates the big picture and helps us in staying on the same page. Vilhelm thought it useful to understand the context to be able to dig into a project, even if the work itself is fairly mechanical. So Vilhelm prepared a vignette to help us with decisions and grasping the task at hand. Vilhelm proposes a prioritized to-do list, work on which is included in the development branch of the fork. Aim to work narrowly on the tasks, without changing function names and folder names, for example. You can get inspiration from the mia and notame packages, for example. Vilhelm runs the checks and ensures Bioconductor-compatibility of tasks done so as to not use time in setting up the development environment for everyone. If commits are only pushed to this fork, we don't need to merge from the upstream, original repository. Vilhelm has a Zoom room open all the time, and is notified by you joining if you want to discuss something (https://aboakademi.zoom.us/j/4826173240).


What:
- present the vignette and your co-operation workflow
- begin by writing unit tests for exported functions 

Why:
- to be able to develop without accidentally breaking anything when refactoring and modifying the code

How:
- agree on the overarching structure of the package, which functions are exported

Have a zoom room open all the time for batchCorr?
