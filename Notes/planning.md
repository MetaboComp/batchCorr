# Planning
**This file is for thinking about big-picture questions in text. The material here wouldn't be fit for the file regarding the big picture, as it is too speculative and undecided. On the other hand, they are so lengthy that it would unduly clutter up the braindump. Also, use the whiteboard for thinking.**

Bioconductor or CRAN: we settled on Bioconductor for batchCorr, in part to evaluate how much time and energy it would take to take MUVR to Bioconductor vs CRAN, in part because batchCorr is more life science researchy
- because batchCorr is rather inherently for life science research
