#' Between-batch normalisation
#'
#' Batches are feature-wise normalised by Ref samples if passing heuristic criteria (CV and fold change).
#' Otherwise normalized by population median (still per feature).
#'
#' @param peakTableCorr Multi-batch drift-corrected peak table (samples in rows; features in columns)
#' @param peakTableOrg Multi-batch original peak table (samples in rows; features in columns)
#' @param batches Vector (length=nrow(PeakTab)) of batch identifiers
#' @param sampleGroup Vector (length=nrow(PeakTab)) of sample type (e.g. "sample", "QC", "Ref)
#' @param refGroup Identifier of reference samples in sampleGroups (defaults to "QC")
#' @param population Identifier of population samples in sampleGroups (all (default) or any type of samples present in sampleGroups)
#' @param CVlimit  CV criterion to pass for Ref samples per batch (defaults to 0.3)
#' @param FCLimit Fold-change criterion for intensity (in relation to average intensity FC between batches; defaults to 5)
#' @param medianZero Strategy for substituting median value for population normalization when median is zero (-> Inf). Either 'mean' or 'min' (i.e. lowest non-zero value; default)
#'
#' @return An list object containing:
#' @return peakTable: Normalised multi-batch peak table
#' @return refCorrected: Boolean matrix with info on which batches were normalised by reference samples; others were normalized by population medians
